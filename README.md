# gb-logistics

This resource isnt fully finished yet. The idea is to get a Benson truck from the company and deliver a box of restock food for the 24/7 and liquor stores.

Some of the code is based on lukes maildeliverysystem. https://github.com/LukeWasTakenn/luke_maildelivery/

### Requirements:

Your own way to open the backdoor of the truck
Polyzone
qtarget
cd_drawtextui
swt_notifications

### Plans:
* Save distance per delivery in table and only get paid when you deliver back the vehicle.
