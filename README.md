# gb-logistics

The idea is to get a Benson truck from the company and deliver a box of restock food for the 24/7 and liquor stores.


Some of the code is based on lukes maildeliverysystem. https://github.com/LukeWasTakenn/luke_maildelivery/

### Requirements:


* Polyzone,
* qtarget,
* cd_drawtextui,
* swt_notifications,
* Your own way to open the backdoor of the truck

### Plans:
* Have it working with ox_inventory stock so it adds stock real stock to the stores and the possibilty for stores to run out of stock
* Save distance per delivery in table and only get paid when you deliver back the vehicle.
* Doing it with friends
* Choose route or single destination
* Chance to get a tip from the 23/7 or liquor store owner.
